Clustering
==========

LXD supports clustering. There is only one cluster object.

Cluster object
--------------

The :py:class:`~pylxd.models.cluster.Cluster` object represents the json
object that is returned from `GET /1.0/cluster`.

.. note:: Please see the pylxd API documentation for more information on
        cluster methods and parameters.  The following is a summary.

Cluster methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A cluster can be queried through the following client manager methods:


  - `get()` - Returns the cluster.
  - `enable(server_name)` - Enable clustering.

  - `server_name` - the name of the server in the cluster
  - `enabled` - if the node is enabled
  - `member_config` - configuration information for new cluster members.


Cluster Members objects
-----------------------

The :py:class:`~pylxd.models.cluster.ClusterMember` object represents the
json object that is returned from `GET /1.0/cluster/members/<name>`.  For
example:

.. code:: python

    client = pylxd.Client()
    member = client.cluster.members.get('node-5')
